Title: Optimal Gene Extensions From Histone Modification ChIP-seq Data
Description: geneXtendeR is designed to optimally annotate a histone modification ChIP-seq peak input file with functionally important genomic features (e.g., genes associated with peaks) based on optimization calculations.  geneXtendeR optimally extends the boundaries of every gene in a
    genome by some genomic distance (in DNA base pairs) for the purpose of flexibly
    incorporating cis-regulatory elements (CREs), such as enhancers and promoters,
    as well as downstream elements that are important to the function of the gene
    relative to an epigenetic histone modification ChIP-seq dataset. geneXtender
    computes optimal gene extensions tailored to the broadness of the specific
    epigenetic mark (e.g., H3K9me1, H3K27me3), as determined by a user-supplied
    ChIP-seq peak input file. As such, geneXtender maximizes the signal-to-noise
    ratio of locating genes closest to and directly under peaks. By performing a
    computational expansion of this nature, ChIP-seq reads that would initially not
    map strictly to a specific gene can now be optimally mapped to the regulatory
    regions of the gene, thereby implicating the gene as a potential candidate, and
    thereby making the ChIP-seq experiment more successful. Such an approach becomes
    particularly important when working with epigenetic histone modifications that
    have inherently broad peaks.
