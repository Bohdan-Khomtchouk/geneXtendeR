Title: Optimized Functional Annotation Of ChIP-seq Data
Description: geneXtendeR optimizes the functional annotation of ChIP-seq peaks using fast iterative
    peak-coordinate/GTF alignment algorithms.  Since different ChIP-seq peak callers produce different
    differentially enriched peaks with a large variance in peak length distribution and total peak count,
    annotating peak lists with their nearest genes can be a noisy process.  As such, the goal of geneXtendeR
    is to robustly link differentially enriched peaks with their respective genes, thereby aiding experimental
    follow-up and validation in designing primers for a set of prospective gene candidates during qPCR.
